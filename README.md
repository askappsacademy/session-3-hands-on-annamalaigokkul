## React JS Hands-On Tutorials


## Hands-On 1
In this hands-on exercise, we will be learning how JSX plays an important role in React Applications
This exercise will contain 2 parts.

### Part 1
We will create an element in React without the power of JSX just to see how much effort it takes :)
Go to App.js file to start this exercise

## Part 2
Now we will re-create the above effort using JSX
Add this new variable below **reactElementWithoutJSX**

var reactElementWithJSX = 
<div className="main">
 <h1 className="heading">Hello World from JSX</h1>
</div>
