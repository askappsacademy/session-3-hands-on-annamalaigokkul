## React JS Hands-On Tutorials


## Hands-On 3
In this hands-on exercise, we will be learning how to pass props for functional and class-based components

### Part 1
We will create a functional component called Greeting.js
In this component our goal is to provide a greeting message like "Good Afternoon" by using props.
We will be passing the greeting as props from the App.js file

## Part 2
We will create a class-based component
In this component our goal is to print our name by using props
We will be passing the greeting as props from the App.js file

## Part 3
* You will be creating a new file called Welcome.js
* You will create a functional component that accepts three props **welcome**, **tutor** and **course**
* Export your component
* The goal is to print something like *Welcome to React from Ask Apps* on the screen
* Import the newly created component to App.js and try to render your component to the screen below your Name and Greeting components
* Convert Welcome to a class-based component and try to render to the screen
